# 🎨 Color Generator App

A simple and interactive color generator web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was made as a **DOM manipulation practice** to help understand how JavaScript can dynamically interact with the webpage.

You can generate a random color, view it in **HEX** and **RGB** format, copy it with one click, and see the background change in real-time.
